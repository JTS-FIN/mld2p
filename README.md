My Little Dota 2 Parser

What is this?
======

Idea is to generate an easy to deploy personal Dota 2 stats parser. It will fetch Dota 2 statistics data for certain 
player(s) from Valve WebApi, and show trends, graphs and other info about how player(s) have performed Dota 2 over time.

What this is not?
======

Not designed to be mass statparser, like http://www.dotabuff.com/ but more for a personal use, with not so massive amounts
of data.
